1)   mostly there there two types of the machine learning   1) supervised   2) unsupervised 

  1) supervised learning :  used the sets of inputs like x,y and gives some information or output  as z 

  it uses the classification ----> where the numbers of outputs are know/ countable or in groups that we already knoe 

    ans regregation --->   uses where we don not know the outcoming of the function 


    2) un supervisesd leariniong we uses the ====cluster ====  where the ouptut is given only on the basis of som cluster of inofrmation .
